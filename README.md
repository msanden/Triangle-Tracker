#### A triangle tracking program, 2/15/2019
#### By **[Manuel Sande](https://github.com/msanden)**

## Description
Application reads input lengths and outputs what type of triangle they form, or if they can form a triangle at all. Triangles get classified into isosceles, equilateral or scalene.

## Specifications and Guidelines
The program follows these guidelines:
* An equilateral triangle has all equal lengths,
* An isosceles triangle has two equal lengths,
* A scalene has no equal lengths but the sum of any
two sides is greater than the third side.
* A triangle CANNOT be formed if the sum of any two sides is equal to or
less than the third remaining side. For example, the values 9, 4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.

## User Story
* A user enters the length values of the three sides of their triangle,
* When they submit their entries, the application outputs the type of triangle
the lengths produce (isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NO triangle).

## Tools and Technologies Used
CSS, JavaScript
