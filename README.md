# Triangle Tracker Program
#### Application identifies if input lengths form an isosceles, equilateral or a scalene triangle, or if the lengths can form a triangle at all. [2/15/2019]
#### By **Manuel Sande**
## Description
The application uses the following guidelines to evaluate input:
* For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
* For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
* For a scalene triangle, none of the sides are equal. However, the sum of any
two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
* Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or
less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those
values. (For example, the values 9, 4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.)

## USER STORY
A user enters the length values of the three sides of their triangle.
Upon submitting their values, the application should output what type of triangle
the values will produce, whether an isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NO triangle
at all.
