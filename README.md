# Triangle Tracker
#### Application Identifies if Triangle is Isosceles, Equilateral, Scalene or NOT a triangle at all. 2/15/2019
#### By **Manuel Sande**
## Description
The application uses the following guidelines to evaluate input:
* For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
* For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
* For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
* easy-to-understand
* Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values. (For example, the values 9, 4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.)

## USER STORY
A user enters the length values of the three sides of their triangle.
Upon submitting their values, the application should output what type of triangle the values will produce, whether an isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NO triangle at all.
